## Introduction
  This organisation is for grouping all the Projects I worked on while at University. 
  These projects were part of assessments and were assigned by the University of Northampton Teaching Team.
  
  While all of these works are my own they may contain templates or starting code from Assignment Setters, however, where this occurs this 
  is disclosed.
